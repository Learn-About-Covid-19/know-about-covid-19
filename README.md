# Covid-19-Travel-Restrictions-Tracker

## User Story
As a user looking to travel outside the country, I want to enter in the name of a country I want to travel to, and then receive covid-19 data for that specific country. 

As a user, I want to see the data of the percentage of the country that is vaccinated, entry regulations, exit regulations, and much more related to traveling regarding covid-19, all displayed on the page. 

## Welcome Page
You are greeted with a welcome page that will prompt you to type in the country you would like to see the covid-19 travel restrictions data for. You can type in the country you would like or you can search for it in the drop down menu that provides a list of every single country. After you select the country you want to see in regards to their covid-19 travel restrictions data, you press the "Let's Go!" button and it will take you the results page.
